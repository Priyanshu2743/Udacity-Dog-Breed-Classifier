# Udacity AI programming with Python Nanodegree Scholarship Winter Cohort 2024-2025  
This project was part of the AI-Programming with Python Nanodregree by Udacity.

## Principal Objectives:
This project focuses on analyzing and comparing various image classification algorithms using Python.
The key goal is to identify the most effective model for distinguishing between images of dogs and non-dogs while also evaluating accuracy in recognizing specific dog breeds.

### Project outline:
1. Measure Execution Time – Utilize Python's time module to track the total runtime of the program.
2. User Input Handling – Capture necessary inputs via command-line arguments to ensure flexible execution.
3. Generate Image Labels – Extract labels from pet image filenames and store them in an appropriate data structure, such as a dictionary.
4. Classify Images & Compare Labels – Use a classifier function to generate predictions, compare them with the actual labels, and store results in a structured format (e.g., a dictionary of lists).
5. Categorize as "Dog" or "Not Dog" – Cross-reference the labels with a provided dognames.txt file to categorize images accordingly and update the data structure.
6. Evaluate Model Performance – Assess classification accuracy by comparing predicted and actual labels to measure the effectiveness of each model.
7. Display Results – Summarize the findings by printing relevant performance metrics, including accuracy and runtime.
